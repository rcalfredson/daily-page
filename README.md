# Conclave: Collaborate in private

## Summary

Conclave is an open-source, real-time, collaborative text editor for the browser built from scratch in JavaScript.

Intrigued by collaboration tools like Google Docs, we set out to build one from scratch. Conclave uses **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types** (CRDT) to make sure all users stay in-sync and **WebRTC** to allow users to send messages directly to one another. The result is a private and decentralized way to collaborate on documents.

For more details on how we designed and built Conclave, read our [case study](https://conclave-team.github.io/conclave-site/).
