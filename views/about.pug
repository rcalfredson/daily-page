    //–— Mission  
    .about-section
      h2.section-title Mission
      p An indie writing lab—started in my living room, fueled by reader curiosity.
      p It’s built not to rot your brain, but to nourish it: a place where you can write slowly, anonymously if you like, and never worry about impressing anyone.

          b Rooms
          |  are topic-silos (think “subreddit, but friendlier”).  
        li
          b Blocks
          |  are collaborative posts—anyone (even “anonymous”) can create one,
          | edit it until it’s locked, and vote on others.  
        li
          b Privacy & Sharing
          |  Public blocks live in the room’s feed.
          | Private blocks hide until locked, but you get a share-link to invite friends.  
        li
          b Markdown & Media
          |  You write in markdown, embed images, and co-edit like in Google Docs.  
        li
          b Trends & Tags
          |  Tag your block, track tag trends, and discover top content (7 d / 30 d / all-time).  
        li
          b Streaks
          |  Keep your daily writing streak alive—your best incentive to show up each day.

    //–— Origin story  
    .about-section
      h2.section-title How We Got Here
      p In 2018, I built a date-based wiki for “today’s page” and watched a few introspective writers turn it into an outlet for their thoughts. It never got huge—but it planted a seed.  
      p Fast-forward to now, and Daily Page is that seed grown into many rooms—a quiet social web for introverts, idealists, and anyone craving a slower pace.

    //–— What’s next  
    .about-section.dark
      h2.section-title What’s Next
      p We’re just getting started: richer embeds, deeper user stats, reputation leaderboards, and more ways to reward thoughtful creation.  
      p Thank you for being part of this little indie experiment.
